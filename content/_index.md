### Purpose of this site

This site is intended to capture thoughts, notes and other experiences that I feel have shaped my career and I find important or interesting. All information on this site is my opinion and no one elses.

### A litle about me

**Name**: Ryan ODonnell

**Location**: Charleston, SC

**Bio**: I have been in the Security industry since 2011 and have had several roles including IT Auditor, Network Engineer, Professional Services (WAF and DB Monitoring) and now Cloud Security Engineer. I enjoy programming and tinkering with new tech

#### _Sidenote_

I would not be where I am today without my beautiful wife and 2 sons. They are the thing that keeps me going.
